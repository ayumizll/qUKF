qUKF
====

An Eigen-based implementation of an UKF filter, allowing the use of quaternions to filter angles


====
A demo is present to evaluate the effects of the filter in 2D (requires OpenCV to build). LibUKF only requires the Eigen headers to build. Standard implementation from the Julier and Uhlman initial UKF proposition (Julier, S. J., & Uhlmann, J. K. (1997). A New Extension of the Kalman Filter to Nonlinear Systems, 182–193.), the use of quaternions being initially proposed by Kraft (Kraft, E. (2003). A quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter for orientation tracking. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference …, 1, 47–54.
